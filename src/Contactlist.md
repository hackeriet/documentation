# Network connectivity issues

## "Code of conduct"

When the network is down in the cellar, we should send a message or
phone people that are dependent on our connectivity.

* Remember that these people are also paying for connectivity,
  therfore should be regarded as customers, so adjust to this well
  known relationship pattern ;-)
* Some of these contacts are critical for our well-being in the sense
  that they have a role that enables us to operate in the wider sense,
  so keeping a good tone and a friendly relationship is critical for
  the whole project.
* Don't act as BOFH.

Note: these people don't read email too often. Don't expect them to.
Sometimes is so much better to send an SMS. Specify that you are from
Hackeriet. Use simple language.

* Ping \#oslohackerspace @ chat.freenode.net upon incidents - it will
  act as war room.

Check this page to see if there are problems with our provider
https://www.blix.com/sections/info/driftsmeldinger

These guys are upstream, so they don't need to be informed about
down-times. They will inform us since they are our provider.

* Take contact with them only when you are 100% sure that the problem
  is not on our side. Always check that our infrastructure is
  correctly powered and functional before taking contact.
* Be prepared and logged in to the right machines and have all the
  available information at hand, so that you can describe the problem
  extensively and precisely.
* Again, regard these people as enablers of our project. So be nice
  and "professional" ( even if it's impossible for you ).
