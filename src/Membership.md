Hackeriet membership
====================

Hackeriet is a members-owned non-profit association. Members have a hand
in the running of the organisation as well as 24/7 access to the space.

Membership is paid monthly by standing order. Running an organisation
like this in Oslo isn't cheap, so please play your dues on time. The
space requires our members to contribute an average subscription of
kr250/month to survive. For students, retirees or low income members the
minimum subscription is kr 150/month.

Membership dues
---------------

-   Regular members: 250kr monthly
-   Students : 150kr monthly
-   Sponsorship membership: as much as you wish. Our suggestion is
    500kr/mo

Pay by bank transfer to account number **1254.05.75124** and mark the
transaction with your name.

Supporting membership is for those who wish to support Hackeriet's
activities financially. We can provide invoices for supporting members
upon request. Contact finance - AT - hackeriet.no.

Who can be a member?

What to do as a new member?
---------------------------

-   come up with a good nickname for yourself
-   jump on our IRC server, because that's where the buzz is (
    \#oslohackerspace @ chat.freenode.net and matrix.org ). Consider
    following up 24/7 in a shell/muxer!
-   get a membership card and a key to the building. Don't be shy, you
    should get those ASAP.
-   come and use the space whenever you have time and will, you don't
    need anyone to do it.
-   put a server or a pi in the \[\[nettlaug\]\] server room and get
    your dedicated IP-address.
-   get inspiration / hydration as beer and Club Mate from the
    \[\[vending machine\]\].
-   show up in person on Tuesdays and Saturdays, bring your laptop and
    whatever else you might want.
-   arrange a talk - tell us about something you care about.
-   host a workshop: show us something you can do, or something new
    you'd like to figure out together with others.
-   organize an event of other nature. e.g. show a movie, organize a
    hackaton/CTF, play music on the stage... - It's your call!

### What do I get for the fee / What is my membership fee used for?

Hackeriet exists for us to pool our resources, exchange experiences, let
us teach and learn, share equipment and offer us a physical place to
hang out together. To achieve this, we need funding.

The membership fee is our primary source of funding and is currently
used to pay rent, fund workshops and buy equipment that the members find
useful at a hackerspace.

While we encourage you to become a member, we don't require you to be
one in order to visit us. Please drop by and see how it looks :)

### Full members get

-   Their own storage space where you can store your project stuff.
-   Voting rights at the general assembly meetings, as stated in our
    bylaws (\[\[Vedtekter\]\]).
-   Right to participate in membership meetings, first Tuesday of every
    month.
-   Membership card for unlocking doors and purchasing Club Mate from
    the vending machine all by yourself!

Keys
====

You need two keys:

-   a key card, which opens the space itself, and

<!-- -->

-   a Hausmania key, which opens many doors at Hausmania, including the
    front door (at least until someone (**you?**) build more keycard
    stations).

We produce our own keycards, but need to order the Hausmania keys.

Email styret - AT - hackeriet.no and request a key, and we will order
one for you. There is a 600kr deposit for keys, deposit is paid by bank
transfer to Hackeriets main account (see \[\[Money\]\]).
