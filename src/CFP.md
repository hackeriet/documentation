# Call for participation

A hacker's mind is always looking for cool new things to learn, thus
Hackeriet is always looking for interesting talks and workshops.

Are you working on a cool project and would like to show it off or
discuss some problems you encountered? **Tell us about it!**

Do you have a pet peeve and would like to hold a presentation and/or
discussion about it? Let us know!

Do you have knowledge you would like to share? **We'll help you to set up
a workshop!**

Are you interested in a particular topic and would like to attend a talk
or workshop about it, please ask, maybe someone knows someone who can
teach us all!

Are you looking for collaborators for your project? We'll broadcast it
and arrange a themed afternoon or evening!

Do you know what your hacker friends and colleagues are working on? Ask
them if they'd be interested in telling us about it!

And last but not least, a looming presentation deadline can be a great
motivation to research a particular topic. We'd be happy to set that
deadline for you!

Hackeriet is what YOU make it! And remember, you don't have to be a
super-skilled uber-expert to have valuable knowledge to share!
