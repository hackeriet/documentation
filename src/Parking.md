# Parking

Our location at Hausmania, whilst in the middle of the city centre,
makes parking (for cars) a bit difficult.

Some hints:

* On the weekends and after 17:00, you can park in MÃ¸llergata.
* Behind Vega Scene, in front of the entry gate to Hausmania's back
  yard, it is possible to park for shorter periods of time. Make sure
  not to block any entrances, and consider safe passage for goods
  delivery trucks.
* If you have a Hausmania key, it is possible to park (temporarily) in
  the back yard. The gate is locked with the front door key.

There are some different [state managed maps](https://www.oslo.kommune.no/gate-transport-og-parkering/parkering/kart/) over available parking spaces. Among the maps are free MC parking spots
and places to charge your electric vehicle.
