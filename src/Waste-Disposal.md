# Waste disposal

For the waste our members and visitors produce, we have four different buckets in the space we use for rough sorting. These cans needs regular emptying by our members.

* Mixed
* Recyclable bottles and cans (with pant)
* Plastics
* Paper

In Hausmania's backyard, there are larger containers where we can take out our bins. Additionally there is a container for glass and metal containers where we can take out our empty Club Mate glass bottles. It's nice if we do this on a regular basis, to avoid filling the container up for the rest of the house's tenants.

For electronic waste, we've used to fill up our basement. We would like to avoid this in the future, so we rather collect a little hump of waste and wait until one or more of our members take it out to one of the waste disposal sites in the region.
