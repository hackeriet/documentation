# Donations

## Financial

Main account number:  1254.05.75124

Please mark the payment with "Donation".

## Hardware

Hackeriet has contacts in the IT industry, and from time to time we are
donated some equipment.

### Guidelines

For anything not on the "we would like" list, the general rule is that
you or another Hackeriet member has some concrete and immediate project
in mind for the hardware.

The principle behind this is that stuff inevitably ends up sitting
around cluttering, and it takes more energy to get rid of stuff than to
aquire it.

### What we have

- 1U and 2U servers
- two full-sized racks
- power distribution units
- wifi access points
- two blade centers

### What we would like

- 1U and 2U servers (modern, perhaps 2 or 3 generations older than
  current)
- NUC's and other lowpower server equipment
- laptops
- stage equipment (microphones, backline, DI-boxes etc)
- networking gear: routers, switches, network cards etc.
- a working UPS with some battery life
- cooling equipment (like AC's)

In addition, we will take donations for any interesting or useful tools
or hardware, but in practice "nice to have"-stuff without a project
isn't, while people who bring stuff with they intend on making a project
out of are most welcome!

Please contact us if you think you have something that might be of
interest (and use) for hackers and geeks.

### What we can't accept

- CRT screens or &lt;22" LCD panels
- old desktop hardware
- broken electronics (home amplifiers etc)
