# Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other!\
This is a no-assholes zone.

We are a community that welcomes the alternative perspective.\
We embrace the full dignity of all human beings.\
As Hackeriet (in whatever space we meet, physical or online), we want to
be able to provide a safe space for all. We welcome everyone who will
adhere to this policy. This also means that we will actively exclude
anyone who does not comply to this policy: we believe in freedom of
choice, and that people should not be harassed or bullied for their
choice, or for any other reason.

Examples are how your body looks like, gender or ethnical wise, your
level of knowledge, your cultural background or your income. We don't
believe that anything could make a person superior to another, and will
not tolerate harassment, bullying, sexism, racism, ableism, classism or
any other hateful -isms at our hackerspace, or anywhere else for that
matter.

Misunderstandings and undesirable behavior do happen â€“ when they happen;
address them as directly, openly and respectfully as possible.\
They will be handled by the board.

Different people learn differently, but we sometimes might not function
so well stand-alone. We learn in communities, from and with each other.
Share your knowledge.\
Different people do things differently. And we should not do things the
same way. No way of doing things is better than another. We can have
better or worse results, if tasks are completed.\
Be inclusive, avoid being authoritarian, and remember: this is a
doocracy. The difference between authoritarianism and doocracy is the
same difference you find between expecting someone to do it "your way",
and letting the subject free to choose how to do it.

Whatever it is we are trying to do, let's do it together, that is often
a good choice.\
Have fun: that is the best motivation to do things.

Trial and error should be the preferred method, as "heterodoxy" might
bring unexpectedly positive results. Results may vary, but learning is
always a good result. Any result coming for getting things done is more
important than the quality itself of the work done, but remember: there
is no result before you get it done.

Hackerspaces are member-run places, nothing happens on its own and
therefore you are expected to contribute.\
Your opinion is not enough. Offer your help.

Go also out and invite people, and be inclusive.\
Give people the same amount of power above the space you think you
have.\
Let people take the amount of responsibility they would like to have.\
Let people engage freely. Let people have fun.

With power, comes responsibility. To delegate power though, is not to
delegate responsibility, we don't do politics.\
Sharing is caring. Don't let anyone take too much responsibility.\
No one has no responsibilities.

Clean up, organize a workshop. Look for things that need fixing and
don't wait for anyone else to fix them for you.\
Improvement is what we should always aim at. As a Hackerspace and as
people.

Be excellent.\
Help others be excellent their own way.
